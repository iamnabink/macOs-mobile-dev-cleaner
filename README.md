A powerful macOS desktop application built with Flutter that helps mobile developers clean up unnecessary build artifacts from their system to free up disk space.

## Why I Built This App

As a mobile developer working with Flutter and React Native, I constantly faced the problem of **massive build artifacts consuming gigabytes of disk space**. Here's why this app was necessary:

### The Problem
- **Flutter builds** accumulate quickly across multiple projects
- **React Native node_modules** folders grow to hundreds of MBs each
- **iOS Archives** in DerivedData can reach several GBs
- **Android APK/AAB files** pile up in build folders
- **Manual cleanup** is tedious and error-prone
- **Developers forget** to run `flutter clean` or `npm clean`
- **Disk space** becomes a constant concern

### The Solution
AppBuild Dev Cleaner automatically:
- **Scans** your entire system for mobile development artifacts
- **Identifies** Flutter builds, React Native builds, iOS Archives, Android builds, and more
- **Shows** exactly how much space each artifact consumes
- **Safely removes** only build artifacts (never source code)
- **Saves hours** of manual cleanup work

## Installation

### Download & Install

1. **Download the latest DMG** from the [Releases](https://github.com/iamnabink/flutter-build-cleaner-mac/releases) page
2. **Open the DMG file**
3. **Drag AppBuild Dev Cleaner** to your Applications folder
4. **Launch** from Applications or Spotlight

### First Launch

1. **Grant permission** when prompted to access your home directory
2. **Select a directory** to scan (or scan your entire home directory)
3. **Review** the found artifacts and their sizes
4. **Clean** unwanted files with one click

## What It Cleans

- **APK files** (Android packages)
- **AAB files** (Android App Bundles)  
- **IPA files** (iOS app bundles)
- **Flutter build folders** (`build/` directories)
- **React Native build folders** (`android/app/build/`, `ios/build/`)
- **Android build folders** (`build/` directories)
- **iOS build folders** (`build/` directories)
- **iOS Archives** (DerivedData `.xcarchive` files)
- **node_modules folders** (React Native dependencies)

## Safety Features

- ✅ **Never deletes source code** - Only targets build artifacts
- ✅ **Skips system directories** - Protects important system files
- ✅ **Permission handling** - Graceful error handling
- ✅ **Preview before delete** - See exactly what will be removed
- ✅ **Open in Finder** - Right-click any item to inspect it

## System Requirements

- **macOS 10.14** or later
- **50MB** free disk space for the app
- **File system access** permission (granted on first launch)
